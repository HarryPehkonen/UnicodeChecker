# more noise. Stages that do not depend on each other (tree, format, version) are
# cheap and run first for that reason. Where a run stops, the summary says so.

# stage, a `pip install git+https://…` requirement, a probe that clones into a temp dir, a

# Unset it once, here, rather than `env -u` in front of each command that shells out to

# one — measured on a real pathspec commit in a throwaway clone, with the gate's own
# stages run both ways: every input the `tree` and `format` stages read is identical and
# their output is byte-identical, and the two views that do differ (`git diff --cached
# HEAD`, the staged-vs-unstaged letter) are read by no stage. `probes/git-index-file.sh`

  kitprobes   the kit fixes this copy claims to carry, held to their contracts: every
              script in tools/kit-probes/ checks one kit fix in THIS gate script by name
              and by behaviour (offline, no kit checkout, no build, <1 s). A missing
              directory SKIPs: it means this copy carries no probe yet, not that it is
              behind. The probes and the rule: docs/KIT-REVISION-CONVENTION.md
  build       cmake configure + build, zero warnings (the stage counts them even where
              -Werror is not wired onto a target)
  tests       the test suite (ctest by default), every failure reported
  release     the SAME suite in a SECOND configuration (CI_RELEASE_BUILD_TYPE, Release
              by default): configure, build, count `warning:` in its own log, run the
              tests. Every other stage builds CI_BUILD_TYPE, so without this stage a
              repo whose own pipeline builds an optimized configuration never checks one
  version     one version number: project(VERSION) in CMakeLists.txt == the header the
              build generates/uses, and the number every binary prints for --version
  asan        separate build dir, ASan+UBSan, same suite
  tsan        separate build dir, ThreadSanitizer, same suite
  tidy        clang-tidy, only NEW findings vs CI_TIDY_BASELINE (a baseline file is
              optional; with none, tidy must be clean). Findings compare line-blind and
              clone-blind — capture the baseline with --write-tidy-baseline, never by
              hand (a raw copy of the log matches nothing: see .ci.env.example)
  pristine    git archive HEAD -> temp dir -> configure, build, test: proves the
              COMMITTED tree is complete (catches files that are uncommitted or ignored)

Options:
  --require-clean     make the tree stage fail when tracked files have uncommitted edits
  --allow-untracked   do not fail when untracked, unignored files exist (deliberate escape)
  --strict-tools      a missing tool (clang-format/clang-tidy) fails instead of skipping
  --write-tidy-baseline

# adapted stages, its own defaults, 60-586 differing lines), and diff SIZE measures
# divergence, not lateness — a one-fix-behind copy is missing 27 kit lines while a
# verified current record is missing 125. See the convention for the measurement.
#
