# UnicodeChecker's gate: the configuration every stage reads, and the helpers they share.
#
# The POLICY is gate.toml (which stages exist, which tier runs which of them, how a failure
# is recognised). The ENGINE is kit-ci, one binary installed once per machine
# (cmake --install build --prefix ~/.local). Everything a stage needs BEYOND that policy -
# a build dir, a job count, a fuzz budget - lives HERE, so the policy file stays a list of
# stages.
#
# SOURCED, never executed: scripts/gate.sh does not need it; every stage script does
# (`. "$(dirname "$0")/gate-env.sh"`). The knobs are the .ci.env knobs the old tools/ci.sh
# carried, each with the default it had there, and .ci.env is still sourced last, so a
# machine with no .ci.env behaves exactly as it did before the conversion
# (2026-10-06, card t_075c0a6f).

# git exports GIT_INDEX_FILE to a hook when the commit is made with a PATHSPEC
# (`git commit -- <path>`): it names git's TEMPORARY index for that one commit, not this
# repository's index. Every process a hook starts inherits it, and any `git` command the
# gate runs inside ANOTHER repository — cmake's FetchContent update step in a `build`
# stage, a `pip install git+https://…` requirement, a probe that clones into a temp dir, a
# repo's own kitprobes script — then reads THIS repo's index entries against that
# repository's object store and dies on the first blob it does not have:
#     fatal: unable to read 691e2bdafaf312970644391de042d38c2c5972d8
#     CMake Error at .../jsom-populate-gitupdate.cmake:186 (message): Failed to get the status
# — so a pathspec commit fails its OWN gate at `build`, naming a dependency update, on a
# tree that builds fine (measured 2026-09-20 on Computo, cards t_9541aa62 -> t_0a9a0018).
#
# Unset it once, here, rather than `env -u` in front of each command that shells out to
# git: the variable reaches everything the gate starts, so a per-invocation fix would
# cover the instance and leave the class. It is also the safe place, not merely the cheap
# one — measured on a real pathspec commit in a throwaway clone, with the gate's own
# stages run both ways: every input the `tree` and `format` stages read is identical and
# their output is byte-identical, and the two views that do differ (`git diff --cached
# HEAD`, the staged-vs-unstaged letter) are read by no stage. `probes/git-index-file.sh`
# holds every copy to this by running the block below inside a real pathspec commit.
