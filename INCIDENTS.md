# INCIDENTS — every real failure, and the check that now catches it

Newest first. One entry per incident that changed how this repo works.

The rule: **when something breaks, the fix is not done until a check exists that would
have caught it, and the incident is written here next to that check.** A check with no
written rationale looks arbitrary to the next hurried contributor (or agent), and
arbitrary checks get deleted. The rationale is the load-bearing part.

    ## YYYY-MM-DD — <one-line failure>
    What broke:        <the user-visible symptom>
    Check added:       <file> + <gate stage that now catches it>
    Why it must stay:  <why deleting this check re-enables the bug>

## 2026-09-22 — `project(<name> VERSION x.y.z CXX)` does not configure at all

What broke:        Wiring the `version` stage needs a `project()` VERSION for the gate to parse, and
                   the obvious edit — adding `VERSION 1.0.0` in front of the existing bare `CXX`
                   language argument — is rejected outright by CMake 3.31.6:
                   `CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:2 (project): project with VERSION, DESCRIPTION or
                   HOMEPAGE_URL must use LANGUAGES before language names.` Nothing configured, so
                   nothing built; the failure is at configure time, not at the version check.
                   The fix is one word: `project(unicode_checker VERSION 1.0.0 LANGUAGES CXX)`.
                   It matters because the bare form is what the repo had and what a hurried edit
                   reproduces, and the error names `project` rather than `VERSION`, which reads
                   like the version stage's own requirement is unsatisfiable here. It is not.
Check added:       `tools/ci.sh build` (configure is the first thing the stage does, so a
                   `project()` that will not parse fails the gate before anything else runs), and
                   `tools/ci.sh version`, which parses the same line with
                   `sed -n 's/^project *( *[A-Za-z0-9_.-]* *VERSION *\([0-9][0-9.]*\).*/\1/p'` —
                   the `LANGUAGES CXX` tail is inside that regex's `.*`, so the form CMake accepts
                   is also the form the gate reads.
Why it must stay:  The two copies of the version number are only worth checking if the declared
                   copy exists; a `project()` line that does not configure makes the whole build
                   unavailable, and the gate should say so at `build` rather than leaving a
                   developer to discover it from a half-written cache.

## 2026-09-22 — a `build/` directory that the gate never rebuilds is a lie about the tree

What broke:        This is the incident the wiring brief names, and the honest record of it is in
                   two parts. Reported: a stale `build/` tree carried a foreign-architecture
                   (aarch64) `build/tests/unicode_checker_test` and a `CMakeCache.txt` naming
                   `/home/harri/hermes-workspace/unicode_checker/build` — a lowercase path from
                   another machine — so `cmake -S . -B build` here refused with
                   `CMake Error: ... different than the directory ... where CMakeCache.txt was
                   created`, and running the cached binary gave `Exec format error`.
                   Measured on this host on 2026-09-22, at wiring time: the `build/` tree actually
                   present in this clone was NOT that tree. `file build/tests/unicode_checker_test`
                   reported `ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64`, its `CMakeCache.txt` named
                   `CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY:INTERNAL=/home/harri/hermes-workspace/UnicodeChecker`
                   (correct case, this path), and `cmake -S . -B build` configured cleanly. So the
                   foreign-arch tree is recorded here as reported history, not as something this
                   run reproduced — it was removed and rebuilt from scratch anyway, because a build
                   directory nobody can account for is exactly the thing the check below exists for.
Check added:       `tools/ci.sh tree` + `tools/ci.sh build`. `tree` requires every path to be
                   committed or ignored and audits the gate's own build directories; `build`
                   configures and builds `$CI_BUILD_DIR` on **every** run rather than trusting
                   whatever is already there. Between them, a `build/` tree left over from another
                   machine cannot survive a gate run unnoticed: either the configure fails loudly
                   or the tree is rebuilt for this host. `pristine` is the backstop — it takes
                   `git archive HEAD` into a temp dir and builds there, so a green run can never
                   depend on anything in `build/` at all.
Why it must stay:  A build directory is untracked and gitignored, which means git will never tell
                   you it is wrong, and a cached binary from another architecture fails with
                   `Exec format error` — a message that points at the file, not at the cache that
                   produced it. Deleting the every-run configure-and-build (or letting `tree` stop
                   auditing the build dirs) restores the state where "the tests pass" can mean
                   "a binary somebody else built, somewhere else, passed".

## 2026-09-22 — the repo's real formatting could not be fully expressed as a .clang-format

What broke:        The `format` stage runs `clang-format --dry-run -Werror` on the files a branch
                   touches, so the repo needed a style file describing the style it already had
                   (4-space indents, ~100 columns). LLVM as a base plus `IndentWidth: 4`,
                   `ColumnLimit: 100`, `PointerAlignment`/`ReferenceAlignment: Left`,
                   `IndentCaseLabels: true`, `AllowShortFunctionsOnASingleLine: None`,
                   `AllowShortIfStatementsOnASingleLine: WithoutElse` and
                   `SpacesBeforeTrailingComments: 2` took the violations from hundreds to ten, in
                   four files. The last ten are not expressible as options: two `<<` chains in
                   `src/report.cpp` broken earlier than the column limit requires, one assignment
                   in `src/detect_nul.cpp` broken at the `/` instead of after the `=`, and four
                   trailing comments in `src/detect_invisible.h` / `src/detect_utf8.h` aligned one
                   column further right than clang-format aligns them. All four are hand choices
                   with no knob behind them.
Check added:       `.clang-format` at the repo root + `tools/ci.sh format`. The ten lines were
                   rewritten with `clang-format -i` in their own `format:` commit, separate from
                   the wiring commit, so the wiring diff stays readable.
Why it must stay:  A repo whose style file does not match its own tree makes the format stage fire
                   on files a change merely passes through, and the usual response to that is to
                   loosen the style file until it stops complaining — which is how a gate stops
                   meaning anything. One 10-line reformat at wiring time is the cheap version of
                   that argument, settled once.

## 2026-09-20 — a pathspec commit ran its own gate under git's TEMPORARY index

What broke:        `git commit -- <path>` builds a TEMPORARY index and exports its path to the
                   pre-commit hook as `GIT_INDEX_FILE` (`<repo>/.git/next-index-XXXXXX.lock`).
                   Everything a hook starts inherits it, so any `git` command the gate runs
                   inside ANOTHER repository read this repo's index entries against that
                   repository's object store and died on the first blob it did not have:
                   `fatal: unable to read 691e2bd…`, surfacing as
                   `CMake Error at …/jsom-populate-gitupdate.cmake:186 (message): Failed to get
                   the status` — a pathspec commit failing its OWN gate at `build`, naming a
                   dependency update, on a tree that builds fine. It is worse than one failed
                   command: the dependency's checkout is left HOLLOW (no `.git/index`, empty
                   worktree, `git ls-files` 0, `git status` reporting its whole tree as staged
                   deletions) for the life of that build directory. Measured on Computo (card
                   `t_9541aa62`, which is also where the `env -u`-per-configure alternative was
                   measured and rejected); the same hole was in all three templates and in the
                   C++ forks, which is card `t_0a9a0018`.
                   The payload is not exotic: cmake's FetchContent update step in a `build`
                   stage is the measured one, and a `pip install git+https://…` requirement, a
                   probe that clones into a temp dir, or a repo's own `kitprobes` script reaches
                   it the same way.
Check added:       `templates/cpp/ci.sh`, `templates/deno/gate.sh`, `templates/python/gate.sh`:
                   `unset GIT_INDEX_FILE` in the prologue, beside `export NO_COLOR=1`, with the
                   mechanism and the measurement in the comment above it. Probed by
                   `probes/git-index-file.sh` (5 checks): it runs the gate's OWN environment
                   block inside a real `git commit -- <path>` in a throwaway repo whose hook
                   then runs a `git status` in a DIFFERENT repo — the block must make that
                   commit pass, and the same bytes with the unset line removed must be refused.
                   That pair is what gives the probe teeth, and it is why the probe is not the
                   "run `tree`/`format` both ways and diff the output" shape the Computo card
                   suggested: measured, those stages' outputs are byte-identical with the
                   inherited temporary index and with the real one, so that check passes
                   vacuously. `tools/kit-probes.sh` now runs a probe once per `# guards:` line,
                   so all three templates are held to it.
                   The hooks are deliberately NOT changed, and that is measured, not assumed:
                   the pre-commit hook's only git call (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`) reads
                   its own repo and the gate it execs unsets the variable, and the pre-push
                   hook never inherits a temporary index at all — `git push` does not create
                   one (measured: pre-commit sees `.git/next-index-…lock` on a pathspec commit
                   and `.git/index` on a staged one, pre-push sees it unset). One definition,
                   three callers: the prologue is the one place that also covers the by-hand
                   run the card's own reproduction uses.
Why it must stay:  The variable is git's bookkeeping for one commit, not this repository, and
                   every process the gate starts inherits it. Without the unset, the
                   shared-tree habit this kit recommends (`git commit <path>` so two agents can
                   work in one checkout) fails the gate that is supposed to protect it, with a
                   message about somebody else's dependency — and the dependency's build
                   directory is left broken behind it. `env -u` in front of the commands that
                   were noticed is not a substitute: it covers the instance and leaves the
                   class.

## 2026-09-20 — a green C++ gate certified a configuration the pipeline never built

What broke:        Computo's GitHub Pages deploy was red from 2026-09-08 and its `./build.sh` had
                   been broken on Harri's own laptop the whole time, while `tools/ci.sh` passed
                   every stage on every run. Both halves have one cause: every stage of the
                   template built `CI_BUILD_TYPE` (kit default `Debug`) while the deploy built
                   `-O3 -DNDEBUG` — its workflow passed no build type and a FetchContent'd
                   subproject set `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` on its consumers. The optimized
                   build hit a gcc 14 `-Werror=maybe-uninitialized` failure that no Debug stage
                   can produce, so the gate was measuring a different program from the one that
                   shipped. The kit's half of this is that the C++ template shipped **no stage
                   that builds an optimized configuration at all**, and `CI_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` is
                   its default, so every copy inherited the blind spot: JSOM, jsonTools, Permuto,
                   Computo. Fixed on the Computo side in card `t_45a28893`; the kit side is card
                   `t_5c2a8ab2` (this commit). Measuring it also turned up
                   `templates/cpp/.ci.env.example` still listing the pre-`a6ad2ea` stages, so
                   `cp .ci.env.example .ci.env` silently dropped `kitprobes` from every hand run
                   — same family, a documented value that quietly switches a check off.
Check added:       `templates/cpp/ci.sh`: a `release` stage — a second build dir configured at
                   `CI_RELEASE_BUILD_TYPE` (`Release` by default), the `build` stage's
                   `warning:` rule applied to *its* log, the same test command run in that dir,
                   in `CI_DEFAULT_STAGES` and in `templates/hooks/pre-push`, full tier only (a
                   cold optimized build is 88–146 s and must never sit in a commit path).
                   `probes/optimized-stage.sh` (7 checks) holds every copy to it, so the stage
                   travels with the fix: the kit's own run is `tools/kit-probes.sh`. The
                   `.ci.env.example` list was corrected in the same commit.
Why it must stay:  A gate that configures one build type can be green while the configuration
                   that actually ships is never compiled — and the repo that finds out pays in
                   deploys, not in warnings. Deleting the stage (or dropping it from the default
                   tier or the push hook) restores exactly that: locally green, red in CI, with
                   nothing in the local output to say why. Deleting the `warning:` count on its
                   own log is subtler and just as bad — the build still happens and still passes,
                   because `-Werror` only covers the targets it is wired onto, which is precisely
                   how the twelve days happened.

## 2026-09-20 — the C++ gate printed GATE PASSED after executing one stage of ten

What broke:        A `git push` on Computo ran the full tier and printed `all 10 stage(s)
                   passed in 0s` while the only stage that really ran was `tree`. `format` died
                   with `tools/ci.sh: line 357: sources: unbound variable` — `set -u` plus
                   `local -a sources` declared and never filled — and bash unwound out of the
                   stage function AND out of the dispatch loop. The run fell through to the end,
                   the end prints the verdict unconditionally, the summary listed one stage, and
                   the exit status was 0, so the pre-push hook let the push through. The trigger
                   is common, not exotic: the format stage takes that branch whenever the touched
                   set holds no C++ file — a docs, script or record change, which is exactly the
                   shape of a kit sync. Found while porting the probe stage (card `t_0cc793fb`);
                   the hole predates that port, and the same `local -a sources` shape was in
                   every C++ copy and in this template.
Check added:       `templates/cpp/ci.sh`: every `local -a <name>` is declared `=()` (an empty
                   array is a value; unset is not), the dispatch loop fails a stage that returns
                   non-zero without reporting a verdict, and after the loop the verdict is derived
                   from what RAN — a requested stage that did not run fails the run with
                   `FAILED: N of M stage(s) did not run`. Probed by `probes/gate-stage-guards.sh`,
                   which every C++ copy carries and its own gate runs.
Why it must stay:  Contract rule 1 is "a stage that did not run must never read as green". The
                   `BLOCK` lines enforce it for stages skipped after a *reported* failure; these
                   guards are the same rule for a stage that dies without reporting at all.
                   Deleting them restores a green verdict over an unrun gate — the failure mode
                   the kit exists to remove, and the one that let a broken tidy baseline live in
                   four repos.

## 2026-09-20 — the python gate's tests stage could not import a src-layout tree

What broke:        An unpackaged repo (`requirements.txt`, no `pyproject.toml`) with the
                   package under `src/` failed the python gate's `tests` stage with
                   `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '<pkg>'` — while the same suite
                   passed two stages later in the throwaway venv. The tools ran bare:
                   pytest's rootdir insertion reaches only the tests directory, and
                   `python -m pytest` puts only the repo root on `sys.path`, so a package
                   under `src/` was invisible to the suite. A flat layout hides it (the
                   package sits on the repo root, which `python -m` already has on
                   `sys.path`), which is why docsum — flat — never showed it. The shape is
                   the worst one for a gate: red on a repo whose suite is green, i.e. "the
                   gate is wrong", which is how gates get muted.
Check added:       `templates/python/gate.sh`: `tool_env` wraps every tool invocation and, on
                   the unpackaged branch only, runs it through `py_env` — the tools see
                   exactly the `sys.path` the tree declares (`src/` for a src layout, nothing
                   extra for a flat one) and never a `PYTHONPATH` the caller exported. The
                   packaged branch is deliberately untouched: there the environment being
                   asked about is the one the wheel installed.
Why it must stay:  Without it the unpackaged branch supports only one of the two layouts it
                   claims to, and the failure is indistinguishable from a broken suite — the
                   clean-environment stage proves the code is fine while the tests stage says
                   it is not. The tempting fix (a `conftest.py` `sys.path` shim in the repo)
                   moves the gate's layout knowledge into every repo that copies the gate.

## 2026-09-20 — the documented tidy baseline made the tidy stage permanently red

What broke:        Following the kit's own comment in `templates/cpp/.ci.env.example`, a repo
                   with inherited clang-tidy findings (Computo) captured a baseline with
                   `tools/ci.sh tidy && grep -E "warning:|error:" .ci-logs/tidy.log | sort -u`
                   `> .ci/tidy-baseline.txt`. The tidy stage normalises the log side before
                   comparing, so nothing in a raw baseline ever matched: `new_findings` came
                   out equal to the total and the stage failed on every finding the file was
                   supposed to tolerate. Three more holes sat on the same line — `.ci/` did
                   not exist (the redirect failed), the `build` stage had to have run first or
                   tidy hard-fails with no compile database, and the `&&` meant the failing
                   tidy wrote no baseline at all. Two more were inside the comparison: the
                   baseline side was de-duplicated while the log side was not (a file holding
                   two identical findings reported one as "new" even with a correct baseline),
                   and clang-tidy prints the ABSOLUTE path from the compile database, so a
                   baseline captured in one clone described nothing in a checkout at another
                   path — the nightly clean-checkout caller was red for a second reason.
Check added:       `templates/cpp/ci.sh`: the normalisation is one function, `tidy_key`
                   (repo-root prefix and `:line:column` removed, one key per finding), applied
                   to BOTH operands and de-duplicated on both sides; and
                   `tools/ci.sh --write-tidy-baseline` captures the baseline through that same
                   function — running the build and tidy stages itself, then printing the
                   `git add` line, because a baseline that is neither committed nor ignored
                   fails the tree stage.
Why it must stay:  Without the shared normalisation the documented path is a permanently red
                   stage, and a stage nobody can turn green gets bypassed — the failure this
                   kit exists to remove. Without stripping the paths, the same red state comes
                   back in every clone and on the nightly job. The lesson generalises past
                   clang-tidy: a capture recipe written by hand into a comment is a second
                   implementation of the comparison, and the two drift.

## 2026-09-19 — the version stage passed while checking nothing

What broke:        Wired into a real repo (Computo) with `CI_VERSION_BINARIES="$CI_BUILD_DIR/computo"`
                   exactly as the kit documents it, the version stage printed
                   `0 binary/binaries report 1.0.0` and PASSED. `CI_TEST_CMD` is fed to
                   `eval`; `CI_VERSION_BINARIES` was word-split only, so the literal
                   `$CI_BUILD_DIR/...` matched no file, every candidate was skipped, and
                   a stage whose entire job is "the artifacts must agree" certified
                   nothing. A gate that fails open is the one shape this kit exists to
                   remove.
Check added:       `templates/cpp/ci.sh` stage_version: the list is expanded with `eval`
                   like CI_TEST_CMD, and zero matching executables is now a FAIL
                   ("matched no executable — the binaries were NOT checked").
Why it must stay:  Without the eval, following the kit's own documentation silently
                   disables the check; without the zero-match failure, any typo, wrong
                   build-dir name or unbuilt binary turns the stage into a rubber stamp
                   that still prints green.

## 2026-09-19 — a repo's own defaults were silently ignored

What broke:        Narrowing the gate for a real repo meant adding the repo's own defaults
                   below the kit's in `tools/ci.sh`. Written as `CI_TEST_CMD=${CI_TEST_CMD:-...}`
                   the new value was ignored: the kit's line above it had already set the
                   variable, so `${VAR:-default}` kept the OLD value. The gate ran the
                   un-narrowed command for a whole run and the "narrowing" was decorative —
                   the summary looked like the intended gate, and the excluded tests
                   simply ran anyway.
Check added:       Both wired repos (Computo, Permuto) assert it in the script itself:
                   the repo block assigns the values directly and says why, and
                   `tools/ci.sh --list` prints the effective `CI_DEFAULT_STAGES`. Compare
                   that line with the adaptation notes before trusting a narrowed gate.
Why it must stay:  This is the quietest way to lose a gate: nothing errors, nothing
                   warns, the stage list is close enough to look right, and the one command
                   that shows the difference (`--list`) is the one nobody runs.

## 2026-09-19 — tests that cannot pass under a sanitizer

What broke:        The first ASan+UBSan run of a real repo failed 3 of 3 suites, none of
                   it the sanitizers' doing: two cases measure the process's RSS growth
                   before/after a test to detect a leak ("Potential memory leak detected:
                   179064 KB memory increase") and a sanitizer keeps freed memory in its
                   quarantine; two more are wall-clock benchmarks
                   (`EXPECT_GT(ops_per_second, 10000.0)`) that a sanitized build is
                   deliberately too slow to pass. The gate was red at HEAD, on an
                   untouched tree.
Check added:       `templates/cpp/ci.sh` stage_asan honours an optional
                   `CI_ASAN_TEST_CMD` (defaults to CI_TEST_CMD), and the wired repos set
                   it with `GTEST_FILTER=-<the sanitizer-incompatible cases>`, so one
                   ctest run covers every suite and still drops only those cases.
Why it must stay:  Without a per-stage command the choice is "no sanitizer stage" or "a
                   permanently red one", and a permanently red gate is a bypassed gate.
                   The excluded names are listed with their measured numbers in each
                   repo's `.ci.env.example`, which is also the list to delete from when
                   the tests are made sanitizer-aware.

## 2026-09-18 — a new file's formatting was never checked (example entry)

What broke:        A source file written and committed during a working session failed
                   the format gate the next morning — the drift had been in the commit
                   the whole time. `git diff` cannot see a file that is untracked, so the
                   format stage looked at an empty file list for exactly the files that
                   were newest, and passed.
Check added:       `scripts/gate.sh` format stage (deno) / `tools/ci.sh` format stage (C++):
                   the touched-file list is built from `git diff` PLUS
                   `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`, so a brand-new file is
                   checked the moment it exists, not after it is committed.
Why it must stay:  Removing the `git ls-files --others` line makes the gate blind to
                   exactly the files a contributor just wrote — the ones most likely to be
                   wrong. It passed on the old list, so nothing else will notice.
